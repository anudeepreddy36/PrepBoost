PrepBoost is an Edtech platform designed for students preparing for exams conducted by UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) of India.
Our vision is to help students during their preparation with the power of technology to make their preparation easier, smarter & enjoyable.
The focus is on providing a testing platform where students can practice previous years questions and get their standings (rank) among other students.
Previous years questions are an integral part of the preparation which are repeated every year.
Daily Leaderboard helps students to find their standings based on the number of questions they solved daily which helps them to be competitive.
Bookmarking option helps students to save the questions which they want to solve multiple times.
Students can Report(!) a question if there is any error or if the answer is incorrect.
The student will get chance to provide a feedback for the test interface and the experience of the platform after completion.
The PrepBoost is a student centric web application igniting the competitive spirits through Persuasion model of Recognition and thriving the young brains with multidimensinal questions to get 360 degree view of topics.
“Education is not the answer to the question. Education is the means to the answer to all questions.”
